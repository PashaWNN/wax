{\bfseries W\+AX} is framework for creating user interfaces(such as home router settings on 192.\+168.\+0.\+1) as web-\/interface and/or C\+LI.

\subsection*{Simple example }

The code below will create a single window with label.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 from wax.Core import WObject, WForm, bind, bindkey
2 from wax.Components import *
3 from wax.WaxCurses import WaxCurses
4 from wax.WaxServer import WaxServer
5 
6 w = WaxCurses()                                            #Creating WAX instance for terminal
7 #w = WaxServer()                                           #Creating WAX instance for web
8 
9 @bind(w, 'index')
10 def hello(args):                                           #Defining form to be showed by default('index')
11   wf = WForm()                                             #Form object
12   wf.add\_object(WLabel('Hello, WAX world!'))               #A label
13   if args['mode'] == 'terminal':
14     wf.add\_object(WButton('Hello!', action='terminate'))   #And a button if app running in terminal mode(we
       can't exit from browser)
15   return wf
16 
17 @bind(w, 'terminate')                                      #We'll call this function when button with
       action 'terminate' is triggered
18 @bindkey(w, 27)                                            #And when key with code 27(Escape) is pressed,
       but it's only in terminal mode
19 def terminate(args=None):                                  #Defining exit function
20   exit()
21 
22 w.start()                                                  # Firing it up
\end{DoxyCode}


But it\textquotesingle{}s too simple and boring and have no functionality. You can see more useful examples in {\ttfamily /examples}

\subsection*{T\+O\+DO }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Authorization
\item Multiline components support for terminal mode
\item Docs
\item Unit tests
\item More components
\item Passing arguments through actions
\item W\+Timer or/and just self-\/updating W\+Form And a lot of different things...
